Dear {{ first }} {{ last }}

A new Computing Society website has been rolled out [0]
If you have received a previous email, then ignore the

Bugs

Despite best testing efforts, things will be broken and/or have some bugs in
them somewhere. If you think this might be the case, you should join the 
website irc channel, and point out what you think is wrong. 
It is highly possible that something may break as a result of the website 
rollout, or migration of data from the  old website. If you think that the 
data is incorrect, for example duplicate location entries for the same room,
then you should point that out to an exec member.

Guest Accounts

If you knew someone who had a guest account on the old website then that guest
account will have been removed. If you know someone who requires a guest 
account for some future event, you should ask an exec member to create one 
for you.

Service Information

The information for the current quota, database and shell account values is
based on that in the database on the old website. It has been recollected to
some extent in order to attempt to correct it, however, due to the size of 
this information it is possible that it is incorrect. When you login you 
should look at whether you have a shell account, database account and what
quota level you have and if it is incorrect, you should report it to an exec
member.

Layout/Ongoing improvements

There is a trac (issue tracking) instance for the new website, at [1].
For any new feature requests or suggested
improvements, you should submit a ticket here. Please look to ensure that
there isn't a ticket already outstanding that covers your issue. In the
medium term you should submit any bugs to this trac instance, we are currently 
only requesting bugs on irc, in expectation of issues being found immediately
after deployment.

Tickets

In order to help with exec organisation there is a list of tickets in order
to assign jobs to people. This can be used to raise issues formally and so
the secretary and presidents can keep track of what the exec are doing. You
can also use it in order to see what issues are currently outstanding, and
what issues the exec, and individual members, have to do.

Mailing List

In order to join the mailing lists that compsoc runs (jobs, discuss, gaming
and techteam) you can simply tick/untick checkboxes on your member's 
profile page[2].  This is based upon your main compsoc email, that we 
retrieve from the student's union, so if you are subscribed to one of the
mailman lists with a different email, it won't appear in this list.

love,

  Techteam
